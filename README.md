# Notes - Desktop
## Description
This is the desktop version of my note-taking-webapp [Notes](https://mybulli.tk). It has the same functionality as the web version but it's more comfortable to run a note taking app on desktop. It fully syncs your notes with the web app, so you don't lose anything.
## Download
You can download packaged versions (.exe, .deb, .app etc.) from the [dowload page](https://mybulli.tk/download).
> The download page will be coming in a few days...
## How to use?
The app is actually self-explaining. Just login with your account (which you can create [here](https://mybulli.tk/signup)) and you will see all your created notes, which you can edit, delete or view. You can also create apps by pressing the "New Note"-Button.
